# CEMRACS2023

This repository has been made for the computer session about the lectures done by prof. Leonardo Zepeda-Núñez.

It consists of three notebooks meant to be worked in the specified order with the following topics

1. Jax tutorial
2. Langevin Monte Carlo tutorial
3. Introduction to Score-Based generative models (SGM)

The libraries required to run this notebook are

1. `numpy`
2. `matplotlib`
3. `Scipy`
3. `Jax` (on cpu should be enough)
4. `Flax` (Jax has to be installed before instlling it)


Disclaimer: Part of the notebooks were based off different existing notebooks/tutorials on Jax/Flax for diffusion models.
